This metadata disables the Update Account with Careplan (Update_Account) flow which sets the Care Plan lookup on the Account record.
It's not currently needed.

You can either manually deactivate all versions of the flow using Setup or run:

sfdx force:source:deploy --sourcepath Update_Account.flowDefinition-meta.xml -u YOUR_ORG_USER
